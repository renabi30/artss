# Automated Robotic Tracheostomy Suctioning System (ARTSS)

## Project Description

This repository contains our code for our project in the course 601.496 Computer Integrated Surgery II - Teams. Our project involves designing and prototyping a robotic tracheal suctioning system for patients on a ventilator. This will include the automatic insertion of the suctioning catheter and the automatic suctioning and secretion detection in the patient's trachea.
