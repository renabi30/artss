## Project Description

This repository contains our code for our project in the course 601.496 Computer Integrated Surgery II - Teams. We design and prototype an automatic suctioning system for tracheostomy patients on a ventilator.  This will include the automatic insertion of the suctioning catheter and the automatic suctioning and secretion detection in the patient's trachea.
